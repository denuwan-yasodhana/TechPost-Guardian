# 📦 Secure Mailbox System

## 📝 Overview
### ❗ Problem
Mail theft has become a significant issue in today's world, where convenience often comes with increased vulnerability. After a clerk deposits items or goods in their respective mailboxes, these items are susceptible to theft by unauthorized third parties. This creates a security concern for users who rely on the mailbox system to receive valuable items and goods safely.

### 💡 Solution
Our project addresses this problem by incorporating embedded technologies to enhance the security of the mailbox system. This solution prevents unauthorized access and theft, ensuring that items remain secure after being deposited.

## 🚀 Features
- **Enhanced Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to mailboxes using embedded technology.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts users when their mailbox is accessed or tampered with.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be integrated with existing mailbox systems.
